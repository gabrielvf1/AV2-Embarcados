/**
 * \mainpage PWM LED Example
 *
 * \par Purpose
 *
 * This example demonstrates a simple configuration of 2 PWM channels to
 * generate variable duty cycle signals.
 * The 2 LEDs on the evaluation kit will glow repeatedly.
 *
 * \section Requirements
 *
 * This example can be used on SAM boards. The 2 required leds need to
 * be connected to PWM output pins, else consider probing the PWM output pins
 * with an oscilloscope.
 *
 * \par Usage
 *
 * -# Initialize system clock and pins setting on board
 * -# Initialize PWM clock
 * -# Configure PIN_PWM_LED0_CHANNEL
 * -# Configure PIN_PWM_LED1_CHANNEL
 * -# Enable interrupt of counter event and PIN_PWM_LED0_CHANNEL
 * & PIN_PWM_LED1_CHANNEL
 * -# Change duty cycle in ISR
 *
